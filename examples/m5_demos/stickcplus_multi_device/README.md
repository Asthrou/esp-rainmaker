This multi-device example integrates ESP RainMaker with M5StickCPlus, offering end-users and developers a convenient way to quickly evaluate ESP RainMaker and its functionality using the M5StickCPlusâ€”one of the many controllers available from M5Stack. This example also enables developers to explore additional features of RainMaker without requiring any circuitry setup or the purchase of dedicated electronic components. It serves as an ideal solution for testing, proof-of-concept (POC) development, or even personal projects.

M5Stack provides a wide range of ready-made hardware products based on the ESP32 series, including controllers, modules, sensors, and complete devkits. These products are designed to support rapid prototyping and can even be used in commercial applications. The objective of this example is to capitalize on M5Stack's extensive range of complete hardware solutions, enabling developers to evaluate ESP RainMaker and other ESP32 software solutions while bypassing the complexities of sourcing and assembling electronic components during the R&D and development process.

## Libraries/dependancies

**Here are the list of libraries and dependancies used in this project:**

**List of dependancies**

```yml
## IDF Component Manager Manifest File
dependencies:
  espressif/esp_insights: "^1.2.2"
  espressif/esp_rainmaker: "^1.5.1"
  m5stack/m5gfx: "0.1.16"
  m5stack/m5unified: "0.1.16"
  lvgl/lvgl: "9.2.0"
  espressif/arduino-esp32: "3.0.7"
  
  ## Required IDF version
  idf:
    version: ">=4.1.0"

  ## Additional dependencies
  app_reset:
    path: examples/common/app_reset
    git: https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker.git
    version: 72845bc

  gpio_button:
    path: examples/common/gpio_button
    git: https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker.git
    version: 72845bc
```

This list of dependancies are in the [idf_component.yml](./main/idf_component.yml). Some of these dependencies like RainMaker, insights and M5stack related dependancies are fetched from [ESP component registry](https://components.espressif.com/). 

- ESP RainMaker related dependancies:
    - `espressif/esp_rainmaker: "^1.5.1"`
- ESP Insights related dependancies:
    - `espressif/esp_insights: "^1.2.2"`
    
    Insights is enabled in this project but no demo of its usage is presented. Can be explored by developers or reviewed in another example. For more information about insights do visit: [ESP Insights SDK](https://github.com/espressif/esp-insights).

- M5stack related dependancies:
    - `m5stack/m5gfx: "0.1.16"`
    - `m5stack/m5unified: "0.1.16"`
    - `lvgl/lvgl: "9.2.0"`

    These dependancies are required to enable rendering of GUI on the StickCplus, it depends on a lightweight graphic library that is great for embedded applications. For more information of their SDK: [LVGL docs](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/).

- Arduino for ESP32 dependancies:
    - `espressif/arduino-esp32: "3.0.7"`

    Arduino, when used as a component, enables this project to run Arduino-based libraries through ESP-IDF. Since M5Stack modules and sensor libraries are written in C++, they are made compatible with Arduino. Enabling Arduino as a component allows us to work with M5Stack module and sensor libraries without the need to rewrite them to make it compatibile with IDF. This approach also lets us take advantage of chip-specific management capabilities, such as memory and power control, which are accessible through IDF but not available on the Arduino platform. However, as of this writing, only IDF version 5.1.4 is compatible to build arduino as a component successfully. 
    
    For more information, visit: [Arduino as an ESp-IDF component](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/esp-idf_component.html)

- Additional dependancies: <br>
    ```
    app_reset:
        path: examples/common/app_reset
        git: https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker.git
        version: 72845bc

    gpio_button:
        path: examples/common/gpio_button
        git: https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker.git
    version: 72845bc
    ```

    Both app_reset & gpio_button are required for esp_rainmaker to function, however they are currently not hosted on ESP component registry. Therefore, they are fetched directly from [ESP RainMaker SDK](https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker). 

**List of libraries in components** 

Here are the list of libraries required for this example.

- M5stack related sensor libraries:
    - [FastLED](./components/FastLED)
    - [m5_lvgl_pck](./components/m5_lvgl_pck)
    - [m5_relay_pck](./components/m5_relay_pck)

## Installation & environment setup

1. Before cloning this project into your local repository, you would have to setup ESP-IDF into your local machine. For detailed steps on how to setup an IDF environment, please refer to: [How to setup ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html). 
    - **Disclaimer:** When cloning ESP_IDF, remember to specify v5.1.4: 

    ```
    git clone -b v5.1.4 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
    ```
    - If you have an existing ESP-IDF in your local environment, please switch to v5.1.4.

---

   **Skip step 2 as we are using assisted claiming by default. This step is relevant only if you are interested in using host-driven claiming. For more information, please visit [**Claiming service**](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/docs/claiming.html)** <br/>

2. A change in factory flash storage (partition) address from default 0x340000 to 0x3f7000 is required, as flashing to the default factory address 0x340000 would flash the factory cert into the wrong address, causing the program to fail on start up. Follow the steps below to handle the certificate claiming. 

- **This is only required to be done once for every device.** 

    a. Clone esp-rainmaker-cli & navigate into the folder.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker-cli
    cd esp-rainmaker-cli
    ``` 
    
    b. Connect the device (stickcplus) into the computer & check port connection.
    
    `i.e. /dev/tty.usbserial-110`

    ```
    // Check serial port status path
    ls /dev/tty.* 
    ``` 
    c. Enter the following commend to claim the certificate. 
    
    `i.e. esp-rainmaker-cli claim  --addr 0x3f7000 /dev/tty.usbserial-110`

    ```
    esp-rainmaker-cli claim  --addr 0x3f7000 <port>
    ```

---

3. Once IDF is in your local machine and certificate claiming have been updated, clone the project and navigate into "stickcplus-multi_device" example: 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker.git
    cd examples/m5_demos/stickcplus_multi_device
    ``` 

---

4. Initiate the respective `./export.sh` with the following command to fetch required components for FastLED, m5_lvgl & m5_relay:

    ```
    chmod +x export.sh 
    ./export.sh 
    ```

    a. Once the respective repositories have been added, edit the following files within [FastLED](./components/FastLED)
    - In the [CMakeLists.txt](./components/FastLED/CMakeLists.txt), change `arduino` to `arduino-esp32` as shown below. <br>
    **pwd:** `stickcplus_multi_device/components/FastLED/CMakeLists.txt`

    ```
    // At line 14
    idf_component_register(SRCS ${FastLED_SRCS} ${ESP32_LED_STRIP_COMPONENT_SRCS}
                       INCLUDE_DIRS "src"
                       REQUIRES arduino-esp32)
    ```

    - In [rmt_LED.c](./components/FastLED/src/platforms/esp/32/led_strip/rmt_strip.cpp), add the following headers in the file as shown below. <br>
    **pwd:** `stickcplus_multi_device/components/FastLED/src/platforms/esp/32/led_strip/rmt_strip.cpp`

    ```
    // At line 2 below #ifdef ESP32
    #pragma GCC diagnostic push 
    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wreorder"
    ```

    b. It is time to build the project. Navigate back to `stickcplus_multi_device` directory and set-target esp32 to fetch all managed-components from the dependencies. 

    ```
    idf.py set-target esp32
    ```
    
    c. After configuring done, uncomment the following code in [m5_stack__m5gfx](./managed_components/m5stack__m5gfx/CMakeLists.txt)'s & [m5stack__m5unified](./managed_components/m5stack__m5unified/CMakeLists.txt)'s respective CMakeLists.txt in managed_components.
    - This is needed to be included for both libraries to be configured correctly as we are using arduino-esp32 components. <br> 
    **pwd for m5_stack_m5gfx:** `stickcplus_multi_device/managed_components/m5stack__m5gfx/CMakeLists.txt` <br>
    **pwd for m5stack__m5unified:** `stickcplus_multi_device/managed_components/m5stack__m5unified/CMakeLists.txt` <br>

    ```
    ### If you use arduino-esp32 components, please activate next comment line.
    list(APPEND COMPONENT_REQUIRES arduino-esp32)
    ```

    **Caution**: Do remember to save files after every change. [cltr+s or command+s]

---

5. Once the changes have been made, Navigate back to `stickcplus_multi_device` directory (If not already there) to proceed with the build,flash & monitor. 

    **Disclaimer:** Do note that a baud rate of 1500000 is used to flash the device. This may take awhile. 

    ```
    idf.py build
    idf.py flash -b 1500000 monitor
    ```

    **Tip:** To check that the firmware is flashed to the correct serial port, check with the following commend:

    ```
    ls /dev/tty.*               // To check connected serial ports
    export ESPPORT=<port path>  // To initial specific port connected to device i.e. export ESPPORT=/dev/tty.usbserial-110
    ```

# Firmware

## Files overview

Regarding the [main](./main) within the project, it is organised in a way that enables developers to add or remove m5 modules as required while the app_driver.cpp houses all of the driver functions
and the app_main.cpp houses the main code. It is formatted as .cpp as these are c++ files required when running arduino as a component within ESP-IDF. 

```
main
|
â””â”€â”€â”€button_module
â”‚      ..      
â””â”€â”€â”€image_module
â”‚      ..
â””â”€â”€â”€interface_module
â”‚      ..    
â””â”€â”€â”€neohex_module
â”‚      ..  
â””â”€â”€â”€relay_module
â”‚      .. 
â””â”€â”€â”€app_driver.cpp      
â””â”€â”€â”€app_main.cpp
â””â”€â”€â”€app_priv.h
```

In order for these modules to work as intended, the required libraries would need to be added in [components](./components). If you would like to try other sensors/modules from M5stack, their libraries are available open-source on github.
You can then add them in the components directory. Consider creating submodules so that the latest version would always be fetched and it is a size efficient way to the project on your remote respo. 

```
