# Matter + Rainmaker LED Light Example

## What to expect in this example?

- This demonstrates a Matter + RainMaker Light. Matter is used for commissioning (also known as Wi-Fi provisioning) and local control, whereas RainMaker is used for remote control and OTA upgrades.
- This example uses the BOOT button and RGB LED on the ESP32-C3-DevKitC board to demonstrate a lightbulb.
- The LED acts as a lightbulb with hue, saturation and brightness.
- To commission the device, scan the QR Code generated by the esp-matter's mfg_tool script using ESP RainMaker app.
- Pressing the BOOT button will toggle the power state of the lightbulb. This will also reflect on the phone app.
- Toggling the button on the phone app should toggle the LED on your board.
- You may also try changing the hue, saturation and brightness from the phone app. 
- To test remote control, change the network connection of the mobile.

#### Optimization

TO optimize the DRAM usage, this example uses the following optimizations:

- Disables the chip shell, `CONFIG_ENABLE_CHIP_SHELL=n`, it adds approx 10KB or RAM.
- As this example has two endpoints (Endpoint 0: Root endpoint, Endpoint 1: Extended Color Light), the default dynamic endpoint count is set to 2. This is done by setting `CONFIG_ESP_MATTER_MAX_ENDPOINT_COUNT=2` in the menuconfig.

For more optimizations please refer [esp-matter’s RAM Flash optimization guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32/optimizations.html)

## How to use this example

This example demonstrates three different functional configurations:

- Matter + RainMaker Fabric  
- Matter + RainMaker Non-Fabric + Static Matter QR Code  
- Matter + RainMaker Non-Fabric + Dynamic Matter QR Code  

### 1. What is Fabric  
The provisioning process uses the standard Matter protocol. Devices can be provisioned using either any Matter-compatible app or Espressif's ESP-RainMaker app.  

- **Matter App Provisioning**: Only enables Matter functionality. The device connects to RainMaker cloud but won't be bound to a RainMaker account, preventing RainMaker-based control.  
- **ESP-RainMaker App Provisioning**: The app acts as a Matter Controller for provisioning while simultaneously transmitting RainMaker user binding through Matter Fabric.  
  - Local control via Matter protocol when app and device are on the same LAN  
  - Remote control via RainMaker when on different networks  

**Advantages**:  
1. Full Matter ecosystem compatibility with ESP-RainMaker app provisioning supporting both local and remote control  
2. Extends functionality beyond Matter standards through RainMaker platform  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. Requires Matter feature integration in both app and cloud  

### 2. What is Non-Fabric  
Literally means without Fabric functionality, while supporting both standard Matter and RainMaker provisioning independently. Users may choose either or both protocols.  

- **RainMaker-first Provisioning**:  
  1. Provision via RainMaker app → device appears in RainMaker ecosystem
  2. Open Matter Commissioning Window → add to Matter ecosystem without reset

**Advantages**:  
1. Independent provisioning paths for Matter and RainMaker  
2. Broad application scenarios with flexible user choices  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. Requires Matter Controller (e.g., Apple/Google smart speakers)  
2. Additional app development needed for RainMaker binding post-Matter provisioning  

### 3. What is Dynamic Matter QR Code  
Implements Matter-standard dynamic passcode generation. QR codes/pairing codes are generated during provisioning and shared via RainMaker:  
1. User first provisions via RainMaker app  
2. App displays dynamically generated QR/pairing codes  
3. User scans QR code or enters manual code for Matter provisioning  

**Advantages**:  
1. Eliminates pre-production QR code labeling  
2. Prevents provisioning failures from physical QR code damage/loss  
3. Enhanced security  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. Requires RainMaker provisioning first when no display is available  

### 4. Compilation Instructions  

**Fabric Example**:  
```bash
idf.py build
```  
*(Default configuration)*  

**Non-Fabric + Static QR Code**:  
```bash
idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.esp32c3.no_fabric" set-target esp32c3 build
```  
*Note: Currently only ESP32-C3 configurations are provided. Other modules require manual adaptation.*  

**Non-Fabric + Dynamic QR Code**:  
```bash
idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.esp32c3.dynamic_passcode" set-target esp32c3 build
```  
*For dynamic QR factory images, add `--enable-dynamic-passcode` during manufacturing:*  
```bash
esp-matter-mfg-tool --enable-dynamic-passcode --dac-in-secure-cert -v 0xFFF2 -p 0x8001 --pai -k $ESP_MATTER_PATH/... (full command as original)
```
*Note: `sdkconfig.esp32c3.dynamic_passcode` file already enable `CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PASSCODE_COMMISSIONABLE_DATA_PROVIDER` option, so it can support Dynamic QR Code function.*

### 5. CLI Commands for Non-Fabric Provisioning  
The device creates a `MatterCWM` service for managing commissioning:  

**Service Definition**:  
```json
{
  "name": "MatterCWM",
  "params": [
    {"name": "QRCode", "type": "esp.param.matter-qrcode", "properties": ["read"]},
    {"name": "ManualCode", "type": "esp.param.matter-manualcode", "properties": ["read"]},
    {"name": "WindowOpen", "type": "esp.param.window-open", "properties": ["read","write"]}
  ]
}
```

**5.1 Open Commissioning Window**:  
```bash
esp-rainmaker-cli setparams [node-id] --data "{\"MatterCWM\":{\"WindowOpen\":true}}"
```  

**5.2 Close Commissioning Window**:  
```bash
esp-rainmaker-cli setparams [node-id] --data "{\"MatterCWM\":{\"WindowOpen\":false}}"
```  

**5.3 Retrieve QR/Pairing Codes**:  
```bash
esp-rainmaker-cli getparams [node-id]
```  
*Output Example*:  
```json
"MatterCWM": {
  "ManualCode": "35306901693",
  "QRCode": "MT:U9VJ0CQM00YHG.48200",
  "WindowOpen": true
}
```  
*(Use `QRCode` payload for QR generation, `ManualCode` for numeric input)*
